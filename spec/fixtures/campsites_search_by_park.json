Each row is covered by a hard, clear plastic strip with slots for dropping registration payment receipts into individual squares. To the left of the registration board is a brown box with a lid holding campground registration envelopes. A 3-foot-tall cannister for depositing payment envelopes stands in front of and to the left of the board. It has a slot at the top for slipping in the envelope. Posted to the left of the registration board is payment information and campground registration instructions, along with a site map of the campground. Above the board a notice reads, Firewood not available in campground. Purchase outside of park. To the right of the board are campground regulations and a tide chart. A recycle bin and garbage dumpsters are to the right of the kiosk on a gravel surface. To the left of the kiosk, a concrete sidewalk leads to a wide patio area with a white, rectangular restroom building with a blue metal roof. The women’s room is on the left short side of the building, and the men’s room is on the right front side of the building. Across the sidewalk from the women’s room is a square, 3-foot-tall stone water station. It’s two spigots face the restroom. A sign on top reads, no dishwashing. The sidewalk loops in front of the water station and leads back to the road. Be advised. The concrete sidewalk ends after about 20 feet, transitioning to gravel, then asphalt. In places along the asphalt section, cracks and frost heaves create an uneven surface.",

Place stub on dashboard. Further along a third sign reads: No garbage service. Please pack it out. Soon, on both sides of the road, numbered campsites begin. The road ends in a loop where more campsites ring the perimeter. In the center of the loop is an island with low growing plants, a large pine tree, a brown metal food storage locker, a bulletin board, and payment canister. The bulletin board is roof covered and has posted notices on both sides. The side facing the entrance road includes information about day hikes at Quinault; wildlife, food, and your safety; stock use; river crossings; pet regulations; firearms and weapons; and cougars in the area. On the opposite side is a box with a lid holding camping permits. Posted above are campground registration instructions and payment instructions. Other notices include campground and fishing regulations, nearest services, how to help preserve your park, and to contact a park ranger or dial 911 in an emergency. On the food storage locker behind the bulletin board a sign reads: Shared food storage for walk-in sites or campers with no vehicles. Place all food and scented items in locker anytime they are not in use. Please do not use for garbage. Thank you. Campsite surfaces are flat and mostly grass and dirt. Each site has a picnic table and in-ground metal fire pit. The sites are nestled in a forest of young and old pine trees. Fallen trees, covered with green moss, lay on a dense carpet of tall ferns and other low growing plants.",
