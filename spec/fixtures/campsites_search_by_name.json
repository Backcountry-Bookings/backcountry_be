          "audioDescription": "Turning off the main park road to the Long Pine Key day use and camping area, is the pine rockland habitat. Pine rocklands are characterized by tall slash pine trees, with peeling brown bark and high green needles. The ground between the spaced out pine trees is a low lying shrubby mixture of saw palmettos, dense grasses numerous wooded shrubs. Craggy, chalky white limestone characterizes the ground, and can make walking off path difficult. If there has been a fire recently, there can be charred remains of burnt trees and crunch ash on the pineland floor Follow the slowly winding Pinelands road to a forked split to either the campground or a day use area. A slight left will take you to the campground. A white building with a green metallic roof welcomes campers to the Long Pine Key Campground. Behind this entrance station is a small patch of grass containing several garbage receptacles and tall information boards including a map of the campground and interpretive information about fire’s role in the habitat. A red payphone stands next to the information boards. The campground road follows a one-way counter clockwise loop, approximately a mile in length, that is in the shape of an oval. Slash pine trees are the dominant plant species, but a wide variety of small shrubs such as beauty berry and sumac add purple or red to the green foliage. As you follow the road around in a slow arc moving south west, the loop is bisected by alphabetized roads ascending from ‘A’ to ‘K’. Each lettered road has anywhere between 5-7 camping areas. Camping areas include a paved slab for vehicle parking, a mowed lawn area, a circular black metal fire ring with a grill attachment, and a 6 or 8 foot gray picnic table. On alternating lettered roads, the restrooms sit in white buildings with green roofs and have two separate entrances on either side. White cement shower buildings have tall green roofs which are covered by solar panels for water heating. Through the vegetation to the north, there is a large blue human made lake, which surrounds an island with dozens of tall slash pines sitting atop the rocky outcrop. At the loop halfway point lies a small parking area and a paved, lighted walking path leading to an amphitheater. The amphitheater hugs the lakeside shoreline and contains twelve rows of benched seating, bisected by a center aisle. A large white wooden backdrop faces the benches as well as a presentation podium for a speaker. The road begins to circle around the loop and now heads to the northeast. The lettered roads begin to move up from ‘K’ to ‘A’ and there are spaced out camp areas on either side. To the south the Pine Rockland habitat extends for over a mile, with the tall slash pines looming over the campground. Following the road, to its completion the entrance station is approached from the opposite side and you can exit the campground area back to the Long Pine Key Road.",

Insects and rodents feed on the wood, and birds and larger animals feed on them. Do not collect firewood in Great Sand Dunes National Park. Please do not bring firewood in from other regions. Help protect our public lands by buying local firewood in or near your destination campground. Firewood can spread insect pests and diseases that kill native trees. See more information on forest damage caused by firewood transport (.pdf file, 510 kb). Regionally harvested firewood is available at the Visitor Center during business hours; at Piñon Flats Campground during the busy summer season; and at the Oasis Store (privately owned, just outside the main park entrance). Collecting firewood is illegal in the national park. Pets are welcome in the campground. Please keep them leashed and under control at all times and clean up after them. Black bears are potential visitors in the campground area. Store items in boxes provided.",

At the entrance, there is a campground fee collection area to the right at a stop sign. An automated fee machine is labeled “pay fee here.” A dark brown informational bulletin board with a glass window is to the left of the fee station. Signs behind the glass include campground rules, do not feed wild animals, and rules for pets in the campground. 170 feet straight beyond the entrance is the campground’s restroom. Restroom is a beige metal building with privacy walls extending from the sides. Men’s room is to the left, women’s room to the right. A square concrete area extends from the center of the building about 15 feet. There is an approximately three inch step up to the concrete surface from the surrounding gravel. An overhang roof structure to the west of the restroom is over a dishwashing sink. The entire campground surface is gravel. To the right of the entrance is a public picnic area with three metal tables. To the left of the entrance are eight group tent sites. Four long rows of RV spaces are perpendicular to the entrance road. These spaces are designated by curbs and posts at the back, center of each site. About 20 tent-only spaces with metal picnic tables line the north border of the campground. No other spaces have tables, and there are no fire rings in the campground. The campground is surrounded by a wide expanse of rocky desert valley floor with short mesquite bushes. Tall mountains with sharply eroded canyons border the valley floor on all sides.",

Campsites on the right side of the road on the farthest side of Loop D are situated next to the White River. A historic patrol cabin that has exhibits inside on the early use of a system of patrol cabins and the history of the round-the-mountain Wonderland Trail is to the right as you enter Loop D.

One restroom is located on the left side of the loop in Loop A, one is on the right near the entrance of Loop B, one is between the picnic area and Loop D, an accessible restroom is between Loop B and Loop C, and one is on the left side of Loop D across from the amphitheater. The Wonderland Trail runs through the campground and can be accessed to the right of the patrol cabin to head uphill toward Sunrise and next to the restroom in the picnic area to head south. Glacier Basin Trail is accessed across the road from the amphitheater or from the right side of farthest end of Loop D. The picnic area runs parallel to the road with parking spots on either side of the short picnic area road, picnic tables are on the far side of the picnic area from the road, a restroom is located to the right of the picnic tables, and a trail to access the river is accessed from the left end of the picnic tables.",
