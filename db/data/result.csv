Two separate mountain ranges are visible to the east and west. Ten campsites are spread out over the entirety of the two-mile loop trail, and are marked by brown wooden posts that emerge straight up from the ground. Fixed to these posts are small square signs with campsite numbers ranging from 1-10, arrows pointing in the direction of each site, and a small brown square showing two white silhouettes of gender-neutral hikers with walking sticks and backpacks. The sites themselves are located in the inner dune areas, which are the flat low points between dunes. The ground here is hard-packed, firmer, and often slightly darker than the soft white sand found in the dunes themselves. In some of the sites and along parts of the trail, you can find bushels of varying types of grasses, which tend to be around 1-2 feet tall and dark green and tan in color. There may also be other types of vegetation along the trail and in the campsites, including the soaptree yucca. Depending on the season, the yucca have two main components: their bayonet leaves, which are dark green, about an inch wide, and sharp enough at the tips to warrant their name; and the stem, which is a tall, woody feature that stands vertically from the base and is often over five feet tall. When a stem is present, many creamy white flowers rest on its tip. The flower petals harden after they bloom in late spring, and transform into firm capsules that house the yucca’s dark brown, round seeds.

Cades Cove is a broad, verdant valley surrounded by mountains and is one of the most popular destinations within Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

Large numbers of white-tailed deer are frequently seen, and sightings of black bear, coyote, groundhog, turkey, raccoon, skunk, and other animals are also possible. For hundreds of years Cherokee Indians hunted in Cades Cove, but archeologists have found no evidence of major settlements. The first Europeans settled in the cove sometime between 1818 and 1821. By 1830 the population of the area had already swelled to 271. Cades Cove Campground is open-year round and combines the feel of primitive camping with the modern convenience of flush toilets and drinking water.

At the beginning of the Flamingo campground and looking west, there is a white registration office located in the median between the incoming and outgoing paved campground lanes. From here, the campground is separated into two loops with road access encircling the campsites of each. Following a right turn to the northwest after the registration office, you are taken to T-Loop which is available for RV and tent camping with multiple pull-through style campsites. Trash receptacles are in the center median as you enter this loop following the one-way road to the right. Many sites in this area have electricity and water. Two shower and restroom facilities are in the loop area. The first one has a water source and a sanitary pump-out station for RVs. Some sites have shade trees. A campground host is located at site number 16. If following the road straight to the west from the registration office, A-Loop will be entered which is a tent camping only area. The one-way loop will take you past turn outs for vehicles and campsites. Some sites have shade trees. Two facilities provide showers and restrooms, the first one has a water source and sanitary pump-out station. Most of the campsites in these two loops have picnic table and fire ring access. Additional sites can be found by following the outbound lane from the registration office. By taking an immediate right turn to the southeast, the ECO Tent area will be on the right between the road and Florida Bay connected by a series of slightly elevated walkways. These tan enclosed canvas-like structures are often available in a furnished condition with each having electricity and a fan. Some Eco Tents are wheelchair accessible. Restrooms and water are available at a facility close to the Eco Tents walkway access. Continuing past the Eco Tents towards the east and located on the right is a low-lying grassy area with some fire rings and picnic tables. This is the walk-in tent camping and group site area located between the road and Florida Bay. This area does not have shade available.

Pine rocklands are characterized by tall slash pine trees, with peeling brown bark and high green needles. The ground between the spaced out pine trees is a low lying shrubby mixture of saw palmettos, dense grasses numerous wooded shrubs. Craggy, chalky white limestone characterizes the ground, and can make walking off path difficult. If there has been a fire recently, there can be charred remains of burnt trees and crunch ash on the pineland floor Follow the slowly winding Pinelands road to a forked split to either the campground or a day use area. A slight left will take you to the campground. A white building with a green metallic roof welcomes campers to the Long Pine Key Campground. Behind this entrance station is a small patch of grass containing several garbage receptacles and tall information boards including a map of the campground and interpretive information about fire’s role in the habitat. A red payphone stands next to the information boards. The campground road follows a one-way counter clockwise loop, approximately a mile in length, that is in the shape of an oval. Slash pine trees are the dominant plant species, but a wide variety of small shrubs such as beauty berry and sumac add purple or red to the green foliage. As you follow the road around in a slow arc moving south west, the loop is bisected by alphabetized roads ascending from ‘A’ to ‘K’. Each lettered road has anywhere between 5-7 camping areas. Camping areas include a paved slab for vehicle parking, a mowed lawn area, a circular black metal fire ring with a grill attachment, and a 6 or 8 foot gray picnic table. On alternating lettered roads, the restrooms sit in white buildings with green roofs and have two separate entrances on either side. White cement shower buildings have tall green roofs which are covered by solar panels for water heating. Through the vegetation to the north, there is a large blue human made lake, which surrounds an island with dozens of tall slash pines sitting atop the rocky outcrop. At the loop halfway point lies a small parking area and a paved, lighted walking path leading to an amphitheater. The amphitheater hugs the lakeside shoreline and contains twelve rows of benched seating, bisected by a center aisle. A large white wooden backdrop faces the benches as well as a presentation podium for a speaker. The road begins to circle around the loop and now heads to the northeast. The lettered roads begin to move up from ‘K’ to ‘A’ and there are spaced out camp areas on either side. To the south the Pine Rockland habitat extends for over a mile, with the tall slash pines looming over the campground.

To the right begins the one-way loop into and around the campground itself. Turning left into the Campground reservation lot, two long rows of parallel parking spaces face left and right along a one-lane, roughly 250-foot (75 meter) long central driveway. The cinderblock Campground reservation station is located at the top of the lot at the right. A concrete sidewalk surrounds the station, edged with low, flat boulders. Note a wheelchair-accessible parking space located at the top of the lot at the right, just before the station. A short, concrete ramp leads up from the space to the station sidewalk. At the top of the ramp to the right, note an automated external defibrillator (AED) device mounted in a small metal and glass case on the side wall of the building. Note there is a second wheelchair-accessible, reserved parking area directly across the road from the station at the left. The reservation window juts out from the left-side wall of the small building, with a thick, 12-inch (30 centimeter) deep wooden writing shelf along its entire width at its base (about four feet [one point two meters] high). Note two concrete support pillars set back from the window on the sidewalk at the front left and right. Bulletin boards on the walls on both sides of the wide, central reservation window provide information about weather in the canyon, North Rim Park Ranger programs, and other camping available outside the park. The North Rim Campground has three A D A accessible family campsites. These sites have larger parking areas, are located closer to restrooms, and have raised fire rings.

In the Spring and early Summer, bitterweed blooms with long, thin yellow petals, alongside the small yellow clusters of creeping barberry, the deep blue to bluish purple, notched flowers of Nelson’s larkspur, the elongated clusters of purple lupine, or the rounded pink and white petals of spreading phlox. Later in the season, the yellow desert blazing star blooms with five broad, bright yellow petals with a tuft of yellow filaments in the center, alongside goldenrod, pink and white buckbrush, wild strawberry, and the showy red tubular, two-inch long, three-lobed blooms of the long leafed paintbrush.

The campground is in a field of grass, nestled between two hills dotted with scrubby shrubs. At the southern edge of the campground is a creek that runs at the base of the canyon. A distant view of the ocean can be seen beyond the mouth of the canyon. At the lowest part of the campground, if you are facing up-canyon, the restroom building is on your right. A short cement sidewalk leads up toward this single-story wooden building with a gabled, or simple peaked, roof. The roof has two solar panels on the roof. One is a solar hot water panel—a grey metal box, about one foot high, with two pipes attached, one with a spigot. The other is a photovoltaic panel, only about 2 inches high. The building has reddish brown, horizontal, wood plank siding. A shallow porch, with railings, wraps around two sides of the building, covered by a roof overhand, supported by posts and beams. You can access the porch two ways. On the building’s left side is a handicapped accessible ramp. The front side of the building has stairs with railings and five risers. On the ground next to the stairs is a metal box with two thick brushes that face inward. On the front side, the porch has a bulletin board on the wall, flanked by doors for two unisex restrooms. On the side of the porch is a large deep sink, with an adjacent wide wooden counter with a backboard, that overhangs and slants down toward the sink. From the restroom location, you can see fifteen shelters—three-sided wooden structures with grey shingled roofs. Each structure is shaped like a hexagon that has been cut in half, open on the side that faces the ocean. Each wall surface of the exterior of these shelters has a solid sheet of tan-colored siding. The interior walls are unfinished open frame construction. Mounted to one interior side wall is a metal box, about one foot high by two feet wide by one foot deep. Metal pegs and hooks on the walls are used to hang clothing and gear. A translucent fiberglass panel at the top of the back wall provides some natural light. Each shelter site has a picnic table located in or near the shelter. Tents are pitched in or near the shelters as well. The shelter sites are about 40 feet apart from each other. At the edge of the campground, on the downhill side, is a water station. This is a two and a half foot tall wooden post, with a pipe running up it to a faucet on top. Surrounding it on the ground is a wooden frame filled with rocks. The post has a water faucet, a small metal box screwed into its side.
